# User-Authentication-JWT-Springboot
User Auth microservice using JWT implemented using springboot

Please note that the auth token from github used in the config server properties file would expire in 30 days, so by the next time if I try
1. generate the new github token and replace the orignal token with it
2. try running the file again!
